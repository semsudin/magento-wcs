**_IMPORTANT_** 

We would like to inform you that on June 1, 2020 all versions of Magento 1 will reach their end of life, as [announced](https://magento.com/blog/magento-news/supporting-magento-1-through-june-2020) by Adobe. 

It is thus necessary to migrate to Magento 2 or another shop system platform before June 1, 2020.

We support the following shop systems with our shop extensions:
* Magento 2
* OpenCart
* OXID
* PrestaShop
* Salesforce Commerce Cloud
* SAP Commerce
* Shopify
* Shopware
* WooCommerce

You can find details on all our shop extensions [here](https://doc.qenta.com/ShopSystems.html).

*Note: If you do not migrate from Magento 1, you may not comply with PCI DSS security standards.*
